# pymon
EveMon clone written in Python

For some time, the continuation of the EveMon Client was unsure so i started my own Project.<br>
Project is paused, since EvEMon got a new Developer.



This PyMon client is based thoroughly on new code in Python.<br>
However i used some other peoples code as input, so credits goes to:
