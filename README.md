# pymon
EveMon clone written in Python

For some time, the continuation of the EveMon Client was unsure so i started my own Project.<br>
Since somebody new was found to continue the work, i stopped my work for now.

This PyMon client is based thoroughly on new code in Python.<br>
However i used some other peoples code as input, so credits goes to:
